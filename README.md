Push The Button was an IoT game we developed to encourge office interaction and a bit
of competitiveness. Built using a Particle Photon, arcade buttons, and multi-color LEDS the
purpose of the game was a capture the flag type of activity where pressing one button would
change the color of the other button and vice-versa. Data was stored in a Google Firebase
database for real-time updates. As part of this social experiment I created an Alexa skill that
queried the database and responded with the current team that currently held possession of
the button.
